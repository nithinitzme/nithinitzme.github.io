I am currently an Assistant Research Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA. My research focuses on quantum error correction, with emphasis on developing improved quantum LDPC codes and iterative decoders for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Before working as a post-doctoral associate at the University of Arizona, I completed my doctoral studies at the University of Arizona under the guidance of [Prof. Bane Vasic](https://vasic-error-correction-laboratory.silicon-studio.com/index.html) and [Prof. Saikat Guha](https://ece.umd.edu/clark/faculty/1891/Saikat-Guha), focusing on trapping sets of classical and quantum low-density parity-check codes. Earlier, I earned my M.S. degree from the [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://dese.iisc.ac.in/), Bangalore, and my B.Tech. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/).

Currently, I am focussed on designing best-performing decoding solutions for quantum LDPC codes - battling decoherance and noise that keeps me awake at night! Using the knowledge of trapping sets as well as balancing circuit constraints for improving decoding strategies is quite fascinating. 

My research publications are available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=FBrIdeAAAAAJ). Feel free to reach out for collaborations or discussions on quantum error correction!
